# File Operations &nbsp; &nbsp;![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.1.2-yellow.svg)

Between projects for data analysis or machine-learning I am always re-writing common semi-trivial file manipulations.
This project contains the functions and file-writers I use often. It's only maintained and designed for my own usage.

This project has a strict NO external dependencies rule, so it's safe for professional use.
